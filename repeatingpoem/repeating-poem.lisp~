; This API is based on abstracting three types of repetative poems that are used as the introductory programming problem in
; the University of Washington's introductory programming class, cse 142. Traditionally, the student only has to abstract
; the repetetition of one poem using Java static methods. I though that this problem statement is too boring so I changed
; it to abstract all of the different types of poem that have been used in 142 in the last year (that is why there are 3).

(defclass repeating-poem-definition ()
  ((poem-opening-lines)       ; List of lines that begin the poem. Never repeats itself.
   (poem-closing-lines)       ; List of lines that close the poem. Never repeats itself.
   (poem-repetative-verses)))  ; List of repetative verse structures. This is where the repetitions are defined.

(defclass repetative-verse ()   ; Definition of each verse that repeats itself
  ((name)                     ; A label for each verse. Intended to be an aid for you when you analyze the poem to breakdown the repetition.
   (introductory-lines)       ; The lines that introduce the verse to the poem. Never repeats itself. 
   (repeating-lines)))         ; The lines that repeat themselves through the poem for the whole verse.
