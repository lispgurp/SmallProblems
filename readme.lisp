; The purpose of this library is so that it is easy to generate a culmulative
; song (e.g. the old woman who swallowed a fly). I have based the code
; on 3 examples (in \examples). Currently, it solves the problem
; fairly elegantly but I believe the intention is hidden in the code.
; So more refinement is necessary, which is what I am working on 
; right now (GSS 10-28-2012)
